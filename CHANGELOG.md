# Quixote Change Log

Changes are listed by minor version, from newest to oldest. Under each minor version, patches are listed from oldest to newest.


## In Progress

New methods:

* QElement
  * top, right, bottom, left
  * diff()

New classes:

* ElementEdge
  * diff()

Fixed:

* IE 8 workaround: IE 8 includes frame border in position calculations. We now create the test frame with frameborder=0 attribute so IE 8's positions are consistent with other browsers.
